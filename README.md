# BestREADMEGenerator

The following is a README generator based on inputs from the USER.

To begin the application, the USER must run node.js.
Once the application has begun running, the USER will be prompted with a series of questions as it pertains to their project. 

When the USER has completed answering the questions, a README.MD file and a badge for the license are generated in a separate file.
This separate file will contain all of the previously selected conditions the USER input based on their desired README criteria.
